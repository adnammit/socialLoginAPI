HELLO!
Here is a simple deployment of the Janrain Social Login application. To
demonstrate, I have made a mock website which a user may log into using Google+
or Facebook.

Step-by-step instructions can be found on the Janrain website:
http://developers.janrain.com/how-to/social-login/implementation-steps/

Helper functions courtesy of Janrain's github repo:

TO RUN:
Since I've used relative URLs, paths do not need to be changed for this project
to run smoothly from any local server.

All you need to do is start your local server, open 'index.php' in your browser,
and try logging in with g+ or Facebook -- your experience should now be
personalized. For even more API fun, Log out and try it again.

View 'API diagram.jpg' for a simplified graphical overview of the process.

THANK YOU!
